**Era - One Sleepless Night for a Better Life**

Sleep deprivation has been shown in clinical research to prevent consolidation of memory after potentially traumatic events and can prevent the development of PTSD.
Era comes to help achieve controlled sleep deprivation in a more natural setting. 

Users will recieve a kit including an EEG headband and instructions to download Era app. 
The user will access the app, set their preferences and if the user is about to fall asleep or goes into REM sleep the app will send different triggers to gently 
pull user out of REM sleep. User can set preferred ringtones and set a contact who will recieve a message/call if the user falls asleep and isn't responding to other triggers.
